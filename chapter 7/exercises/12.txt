Suppose that i is a variable of type int, f is a variable of type float, and d is a variable of type double.
Explain what conversions take place during the execution of the following statement:

d = i + f

i + f will produce float as float is the larger sized type

another conversion happens when assigning the result to variable d of type double. The result of type float is 
converted to double when assining to d
